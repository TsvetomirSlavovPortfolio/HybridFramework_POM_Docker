Functionality in Hybrid Framework:


Maven project. We will not download individual jars as we did earlier, rather we will add dependencies in our pom.xml file.
And of course, it will a Selenium, TestNG project.
We will include like Page Object Modeling, Page Factory concepts in our framework.
We will add Data Driven technique in our framework for test data input.
The framework will have Log4j logging.
In addition to TestNG reports, we will also include Extent Reports for advanced HTML reports.
We will create user defined methods for different actions.
And we will also add a new topic in our Hybrid Framework and that is the use of properties file in order to store some configurable parameters of our application.


What is the difference between “-Dmaven.test.skip.exec” vs “-Dmaven.test.skip=true”?

"maven.test.skip.exec=true" the tests get compiled, but not executed.
"maven.test.skip=true" doesn't compile or execute the tests.
